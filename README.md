# KTaNE Expert Manuals

This program contains all the manuals that are required to play archipelago. Rule seed is adapted to the correct AP Slot and is automatically applied. Please download the one that is the same as your OS.

You can download the APWorld needed for this at [this address](https://github.com/GreenPower713/Archipelago/releases).

The defuser client mod can be found on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/). 
Please refer to the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/GreenPower713/Archipelago/blob/main/worlds/ktane/docs/setup_en.md) for all the needed information.

## FAQ
### The manuals do not contain the same symbols as the bomb. What is happening?
You probably didn't install the [Rule Seed Modifier mod by samfundev](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2037350348) as mentioned in the 
[Setup Guide](https://github.com/GreenPower713/Archipelago/blob/main/worlds/ktane/docs/setup_en.md). If you are sure you did, please refer to the pin messages in the Discord thread. 
If it still doesn't work, feel free to ping me.

### Why doesn't the program work when I double click on it on MacOS?
As an alpha build, I didn't bundle it in an .app file. This means that I can't certify that it will work with a double-click; it might. If not, you can run it via a terminal by following these instructions.
1. Open a terminal
2. Use the "cd" command to change the working directory to the one containing the program.
3. Run ./KTaNEExpertManualsClient_mac

This should work. If you need assistance, feel free to ping me in the Discord thread.
